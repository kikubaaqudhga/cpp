# cpp

I will be learning C++ here. I will be using the youtube tutorial I found in 2 seconds of googling:

Apparently now everything is italics in the editor. I don't know how to change it back.
I will be using Dev-C++ since it is the same IDE I used for C, though the tutorial specifies a different IDE. Hopefully this won't be an issue. I prefer to focus learning on a select few topics, and I would think github and C++ combined will keep me busy enough. My 'end goal', aside from learning the language, will be to remake a jank program I made in C a while back, a recipe randomizer. Without further ado, let's see how this goes.
